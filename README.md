# FrothFET 12Ch

A [Yarrboard](https://github.com/hoeken/yarrboard) ESP32 based control board designed for marine applications.  Featuring:

* 12 x load driver channels with:
  * 20A current maximum per channel
  * built-in ATC fuses with bypass mode
  * current sensing
  * voltage sensing (run detection + fuse failure + bypass detection)
  * M4 (#8) screw terminals for secure and easy setup
  * dimmable with PWM control
* 4 x tank sender inputs (0-180ohm, 240-33ohm, 4-20mA, or 0-5V compatible)
* 12v or 24v supply
* 100A total system power (beefy lasercut copper busbar)
* easy system fusing with MEGA or MBRF fuse on busbar.
* 2x cooling fan headers with PWM or on/off control
* ESP32-S3 controller with WiFi, Bluetooth, USB-C, etc.
