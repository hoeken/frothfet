FAD3171MXA

* 100% duty cycle - charge pump circuit has lots of caveats
* 110V supply
* 3.3v logic compatible
* needs external 15v supply?
* turn on 50ns
* turn off 50ns
* datasheet terrible
* not available til october?

NCP51752

* unclear on 100% duty cycle?
* 30v supply voltage
* datasheet very opaque

NCP51152

* unclear on 100% duty cycle
* 30v supply voltage
* datasheet very opaque

LT1910
* charge pump
* 60v supply
* 220uS turn on (slow)
* 25uS turn off (slow)

UCC2753x
* charge pump?  unclear?
* 10-35v input
* soic
* 15ns / 7ns (fast!)
* no motor control examples
* might be low side?

TC4431
* 30v
* charge pump? unclear

AUIR3241S
* 36v
* ???

MIC5014
* 30v operation
* 100% on time
* simple
* turn on (90us) slow
* turn off (6us) slowish

MIC5021
* 36v operation
* 100% duty
* 500ns rise / fall (fast)
* 3.3v compatible
* 12v operation needs logic level mosfet! (+/- 10vgs)

LTC7004
* 60v operation
* 100% duty cycle
* fast switching times - unclear how fast.  ns on datasheet.
* 3.3v compatible
* simple implementation
