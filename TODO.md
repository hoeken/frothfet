# FrothFET 8CH

### Rev E Changes:

* 3d model for terminal block
* better silkscreen for terminal block
* channels:
  * add current measurement chip alternates
* implement esp32-s3 dev module onto the board as sub schematic (re-draw waveshare module)
* consolidate components to standard values where possible.
* change to M/F standoffs + captive nuts or heat press inserts
* can we move mounting holes to allow for symmetric case design?
* see what improvements can be made for noise and ADC routing.
