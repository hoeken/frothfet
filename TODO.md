# FrothFET 8CH

FrothFET notes:

* Test fully loaded all channels
* debug / test MCP3564R
  * read the datasheet and make notes
  * analyze each command and response
  * connect IRQ, MCLK to esp32
* test ADS1115 chips
  * connect ALERT/RDY to esp32
* determine if we will keep the ADC regulator - measure DC
* determine if we will keep the ADC vref

TODO: 

* consolidate to a single ADC chip
